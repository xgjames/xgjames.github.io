I’m familiar with iCloud backup and restore, being aware of that iCloud network could never be fully functional using PRC Internet. You have a data cloud and you use it. Lightening is for charging only. Seems straight. <br />
Still, the requirement of 5.8GB storage for installing iOS 8 on my iPhone 5s is kinda surprising. Good time to ditch those apps you seldom use and get more storage released. Of course the best option is to get a 64GB or 128GB device next time. <br />
More excitement comes from Xcode 6.0.1, since I’ve been working as a full-time developer for over 3 months. It’s never too late to learn, especially to learn Swift. Some colleagues have dived into the new programming language since the beta version was released.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/2014/09/23/some-thoughts-after-ios-8-ota/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">8b3a91f5-781c-4a7d-811b-474679fb3b47</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[James]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 00:45:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to TestFlight.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to run a blog on GitHub using Ghost and Buster.</p>
