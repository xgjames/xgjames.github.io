I just got the notion of adding one more post here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Private journal. Like the third tip in <a href='http://www.wikihow.com/Dissuade-Yourself-from-Becoming-a-Blogger' >How to Dissuade Yourself from Becoming a Blogger</a>, I do have a journal for life and work. There have been  a lot of txt files naming by date since 2012, and it keeps growing. Still sometimes it feels right to post something longer than a tweet on the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Time and efficiency. I sincerely agree with the third and fourth reason in <a href='http://libroediting.com/2013/08/12/10-reasons-not-to-write-a-blog/' >10 Reasons Not to Write A Blog</a>. Efficiency is crucial for getting self-organized and finding more time. Focus is important, also.</p></li>
<li><p>Target market / readership. Things are getting complicated here. There are way too many topics I find myself interested in, yet too few of which I am really proficient in. I started self-studying to become an iOS developer in October, 2013. I got the full-time job last June, which I am still working on now. It is kinda fancy and trendy to run a tech blog as a developer, yet I find myself hesitating. I have no idea who I am writing to or I should write to. Hope I could find out sooner.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, I will keep this blog updated as I could. Good night.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/2015/01/07/things-keep-me-from-blogging/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">dab3d0c3-139d-4ce0-aa5a-054bfe75e1aa</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[James]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 12:50:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some thoughts after iOS 8 OTA]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It’s like a custom that upgrading iOS OTA (Over the Air). I’m familiar with iCloud backup and restore, being aware of that iCloud network could never be fully functional using PRC Internet. You have a data cloud and you use it. Lightening is for charging only. Seems straight. <br />
Still, the requirement of 5.8GB storage for installing iOS 8 on my iPhone 5s is kinda surprising. Good time to ditch those apps you seldom use and get more storage released. Of course the best option is to get a 64GB or 128GB device next time. <br />
More excitement comes from Xcode 6.0.1, since I’ve been working as a full-time developer for over 3 months. It’s never too late to learn, especially to learn Swift. Some colleagues have dived into the new programming language since the beta version was released.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/2014/09/23/some-thoughts-after-ios-8-ota/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">8b3a91f5-781c-4a7d-811b-474679fb3b47</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[James]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 00:45:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to TestFlight.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to run a blog on GitHub using Ghost and Buster.</p>
